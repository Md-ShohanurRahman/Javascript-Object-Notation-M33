<!--  What is the Internet? -->
The Internet is a global network of computers that are all connected together to share information and communicate with each other.

Term	        Meaning
Server	        A powerful computer that stores websites/apps.
Client	        Your computer or phone that requests data.
IP Address	    Like a home address for computers on the internet.
Router	        A device that connects your home to the internet.
Browser	        A program (like Chrome or Firefox) to view websites.

<!-- üåê 1. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) -->

An IP address is like a home address for every device on the internet. It helps identify and locate devices so they can send and receive data.

<!--  DNS (Domain Name System) -->
DNS is like the phonebook of the internet.
It converts human-readable names .

Humans remember names better than numbers, and computers understand numbers (IP addresses).
DNS makes it easier for us to access websites without needing to remember IPs.

üîπ How DNS Works (Step-by-Step):
You type www.facebook.com in your browser.

The browser asks the DNS server: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the IP address for this name?‚Äù

DNS responds with the IP: 157.240.22.35

Your browser uses this IP to connect to Facebook‚Äôs server.

<!-- üß≠ **What is a Browser?** -->

A Browser (or Web Browser) is a software application** that allows you to **access, view, and interact** with websites on the Internet.


‚öôÔ∏è What does a browser do?
When you enter a web address like `www.example.com`, the browser:

1. Sends a request** to the server (using DNS and IP address).
2. Receives HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** code from that server.
3. Renders the content** so you can **see and interact** with it.

 Key Components Inside a Browser:
| Part               | Role                                               |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Address Bar**     | Where you type website URLs.                      |
| **Rendering Engine** | Displays the web page (e.g., Blink in Chrome).    |
| **JavaScript Engine** | Runs JavaScript code (e.g., V8 in Chrome).       |
| **Tabs**             | Let you view multiple pages at once.             |
| **Dev Tools**        | Tools for developers (Inspect, Console, etc.)    |

## üéØ Summary:
- A browser is like a translator and artist ‚Äî it understands code (HTML, CSS, JS) and displays it** in a beautiful, interactive way.
- Without a browser, we couldn't visit websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, or write and run JavaScript easily!

<!-- What is HTTP? -->
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.

üîπ It is the communication protocol that allows your browser and server to talk to each other when loading a webpage.

Think of HTTP like a language that browsers and servers use to send and receive data.


<!-- üîê What is HTTPS? -->
HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure.

üîπ It is the secure version of HTTP ‚Äî it uses encryption to protect the data being sent and received.

Imagine HTTPS as HTTP with a locked envelope, so no one can read your messages while they travel on the internet.

<!--  What is JSON? -->
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
It is a lightweight format used to store and exchange data.

JSON data is written in key-value pairs
‚úÖ Keys and string values are always in double quotes

JSON vs JavaScript Object

Feature	JSON	                                JavaScript Object
Format	Text only	                             Real object in memory
Quotes	Keys must be in double quotes	        Quotes are optional for keys
<!-- Data types	Limited (no functions)	        Full types (functions, etc.) -->
